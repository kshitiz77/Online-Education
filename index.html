            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to
                education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of
                technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in
                developing countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures
                through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

                India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to
                deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation
                launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach
                more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools
                (LCPS) found that over 5-year period to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All
                (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.[58] The
                polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach
                disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially
                sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which
                support LCPSs.[58] Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This
                success is attributed to excess demand.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings
                together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational
                psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the
                interactions between biological processes and education.[74][75][76][77] Researchers in educational
                neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading,[76] numerical cognition,[78] attention, and
                their attendant difficulties including dyslexia,[79][80] dyscalculia,[81] and ADHD as they relate to
                education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the
                establishment of educational neuroscience research.</p>
